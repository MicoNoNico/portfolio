        <span>Hi there, I’m Nico and I’m an aspiring Game UI and UX designer.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently based in Groningen, Netherlands where I am studying Game Design at Hanze University of Applied Sciences.
        I love learning about design, especially when it comes to the user experience and interactions with games.
        As I plan to expand my competencies, I have been learning 3D modelling and animating in Blender,
        as well as programming in C# for various Unity projects, for personal and student purposes.
        <br>
        <br>
        While I try to be competent in multiple fields, I am passionate about making the best user experience possible when interacting with a game.
        I love wireframing/designing/making interfaces, creating concepts for levels and characters. Putting it all together and watching your work take
        life is what drives me forward.
